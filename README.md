## Flowfund

#### About
Flowfund is a decentralized crowd-funding platform which allows anyone to create campaigns and to donate to others using
    Ethereum. It's hosted on the Arweave permaweb, and is entirely decentralized in its operation.

To use Flowfund if you'd like to fund an endeavor, simply log in using MetaMask and your Arweave wallet. From there, you
    can create a campaign and allow people to donate to you. Once you've reached your goal, you'll need to provide
    evidence to prove that you really will deliver on the project which you crowd-funded. Once this proof has been
    provided, and a majority of the contributors have agreed to release the funds, you will be able to withdraw them
    from the Flowfund smart contract to your own account.

To use Flowfund as a funder, simply browse around for a project that you'd like to fund. Once you've found one, you can
    sign in using your Arweave keyfile and MetaMask in order to fund it. Make sure to come back once the author of the
    campaign has provided their proof, and to vote on whether to release the funds or not!

There are of course certain limitations with Flowfund, primarily the fact that **you should in no circumstances
    whatsoever use it outside of a testnet at the moment**. The smart contract logic has not been extensively tested,
    and may have bugs. Therefore you should not trust it with anything other than your testnet Ether!
